My Treehouse FSJS TechDegree Project 2 - Pagination, by Kris Hatch-McCarter.  

Using JavaScript to select HTML elements, listen for events and create pagination buttons dynamically to navigate a long list of items.  

    Concepts used in this project:
    Using selectors
    DOM manipulation
    Functions
    Loops
    Event Listeners
    Debugging using DevTools

This project takes a student list of any size in the HTML file and serves up the fist ten with pagination buttons at the bottom of the list for each subsequent set of ten (or less on the very last page, depending on how many items are in the list).  The page loads displaying a list of 10 student with the first pagination button active for students 1-10.  The page listens for click events on the pagination buttons.  A click will turn the button active and change the display to those corresponding students.
